## Contribution
1. Clone the repository using git.
2. Find your language folder. If Dutch, see 'nl.Iproj'. The names are related to [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1).
3. Edit the Localizable.strings to be better. The left sides are keys, the right sides are values. For example, "Thanks♥"="Dank je wel♥"; means "Thanks♥"→"Dank je wel♥".
4. Make a commit, push it, and create a pull request.

If your contribution has been accepted, ge-calc uses your strings.
